\bf Abstract
\end{center}

\noindent ZVAA uses a test-expression 
to reduce costs of sign computation
massively in many typical cases.
On the other hand, 
the test-expression produces an overhead
of two additional operations
in the approximation calculations.
We propose to use the test-expression 
only to estimate a sufficient precision
for the approximation calculations,
but not for the approximation calculations
themselves.
A simple correction of the estimated precision
allows for doing so.
This new method, called MOSC, seems to dominate BFMSS.
